# Livdin

## Description 


Livdin is a web application that lets users post reviews on previous and current place of residence. The application is being designed with the idea of giving individuals a space to review their current place of residence free from the real estate pressure. Reviews can contain information such as expressing opinion of previous or current place of residence, how landlords handle maintaince issues, how expense utilities bills range etc.
